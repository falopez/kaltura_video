DEPENDENCIES:

	Elgg 1.5, 1.6, 1.7
	CURL libraries for PHP needed!!!

INSTALL:

	0. Please be sure that you have Elgg installed in a site with CURL
	   libraries for PHP

	1. Copy the directory kaltura_video/ and all his files to the
	   plugins folder in elgg_path/mod/

	2. Activate the plugin in tools administration

	3. Configure the plugin by clicking in
	   "Administration" -> Kaltura Video Admin

	   IMPORTANT: You need be a partner of kaltura.com or have your own
	   copy of Kaltura Community Edition (CE) in order to use this
	   plugin.
	   This plugin has an integraded form to register to Kaltura.
	   Do it in "Administration" -> Kaltura Video Admin

UPGRADING FROM OLDER VERSIONS:

	1. Completly remove the old kaltura_video/ directory in the
	   plugin's folder (mod/) and put the new one instead

	2. Check the configuration options by login into your Elgg
	   installation as admin and go to:
	   "Administration" -> Kaltura Video Admin

	3. Run the "Recreate all video objects" as administrador if your
	   older version is lower than 1.0

	4. That's all, enjoy it!

KALTURA CE SERVER

	You can change the server and the flash widgets used in the plugin
	by login into your Elgg installation as admin and go to:
	"Administration" -> Kaltura Video Admin

TINYMCE INTEGRATION

	This plugin can be integrated into TinyMCE rich text editor. To do
	that, simply go to "Administration" -> Kaltura Video Admin
	and choose "Try to integrate into tinyMCE".

	However	there are a lot versions of this plugin and the integration
	method is far away from perfection.

	So, if something is broken after activating the integration,
	deactivate it and report me this issue!

ADVANCED IMPORT VIDEOS FROM KALTURA

	From version 1.0 you can easyly import videos created outside Elgg
	in Kaltura (for example with the drupal or wordpress plugin).

	To do that, go to Kaltura's CMS (or your own copy of Kaltura CE):
	http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/kmc

	Login in, edit the "Video Mix" videos (you can only import this kind
	of videos). Put the "Admin Tags" property with the value of
	"elgg_plugin" followed by the username in Elgg you want to assign
	the video.

	EX:

	If you want to import a video from Kaltura's CMS to the user "foo"
	("foo" is the username, not the name of the user) edit the details
	of the video in Kaltura's CMS and let the Admin tags like this:

	elgg_plugin foo

	Then go to your Elgg installation and run "Recreate objects" logged
	intoo and admin account.
